A number of simple computer vision projects

## Projects description:

### image alignment:
Two different methods for aligning three channels of an image inorder to make an RGB image. This project takes digitized Prokudin-Gorskii glass plate images and automatically produce a color image with as few visual artifacts as possible. The alignment methods are either through gradient descent or through exhaustive search for finding the alignment with the smallest error.
